# vehicle-carsignal-examples
W3C Vehicle Information API examples, server side and client side 

The example contains Java server code using GLASSFISH Server 4.1, HTML and Javascript client, a Java application, a CarSignal simulation library, Qt Qml client, iPhone client and an Android client running against w3c VIS spec.

The Java part was developed using NetBeans 8.1.
Qt 5.7 was used to develop the Qt client.

License is GPLv3 or as for the iPhone part the MIT license is used.

The server currently implements SUBSCRIBE and UNSUBSCRIBE. The "simulated" signal is speed and door.*, and the implementation serves as a CONCEPT STUDY.
